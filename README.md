# 20COA108-Questions

### General info
Questions to gain a better understanding of Haskell and functional programming.

#### Part 1
* a) List and explain 3 benefits that Functional Programming brings to programmers.
* b) Explain in your own words what a (mathematical) function is and discuss to what extent Haskell functions resemble mathematical functions.
* c) Explain what a higher-order function is.

#### Part 2
* a) Define a function steps that takes three positive Int values m n p and returns a String that can be displayed as p steps, of height m and width n, the right way up, and repeats the pattern in opposite way.
* b)  Define a function flagpattern that takes two positive Int values n greater than or equal to 5, and m greater than or equal to 1, and returns a String that can be displayed as the following m 'flag' patterns of dimension n.

#### Part 3
* Define a function compatibility, that takes two String values representing persons names, and outputs their compatibility.

#### Part 4
* Define a polymorphic function lsplit that is applied to two arguments of types [a] and a, where a is a type on which == is defined, and partitions the original list at occurrences of the second argument and returns a list of int values of the number of elements for each part.
